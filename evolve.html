<h4> Evolvement of programming languages </h4>
<p> It all first started from Charles Babbage and Lovelaces Analytical Engine. This slowly led to the first programming language It was a proper 100 years before electronic hardwares like programmable computers. Machine-specific assemblies language present in the 1940s was probably the first readable programming languages. As developers constantly used this assembly language they slowly realized that this language is to pron to errors when constructing different systems. Because of this in the 1950s FORTRAN, ALGOL, LISP,COBOL was introduced. All these languages were used for the construction of systems, applications etc. Even today these languages are used. In 1964 the new language was introduced "BASIC". Then later along C was introduced. Today linux is mostly written through C as well as windows, Mac OS. PASCAL was then introduced. PASCAL was used for structuring and was also used to teach programming. In 1983 the new C++ was created. C++ were used for GUIS, game engines and in multiple other suites. Then came PERL which was able to work with UNIX and is able to manipulate text. Python was then introduced and was used to fix problems in the ABC language. Python is used by NASA, YOUTUBE. Ruby was then introduced were the language was consisted of blending parts regarding Perl,Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada and Lisp.Moving on, on 1990 JAVA was introduced a was used to set up microsystems and run set top boxes . Java now runs on 1.1billion PCs. Java Script was then introduced . Java Script is essential for web-development and the usage of different servers like node.js. Ruby on rails was introduced in 2005. A single game applciation for the iphone used 2 million lines of code of Ruby.
