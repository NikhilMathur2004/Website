<h4> ALGOL </h4>
<p>ALGOL was designed by an international comittee of computer scientisits. The main goal for this language was for expressing different mathematical algorithms, equations. ALGOL never really achieved the success compared to other programming languages. Today ALGOL is not existend but is used a reminder regaridng the progress. But ALGOL has introduced multiple unqiue features which programming languages use today. Some features are BNF notation. BNF stands for Backus Naur Form. This means and describes the particular syntax of a computer language. It is like a short hand for computer languages. Statement blocks were a series of programming statements are bunched together. Liek putting groups inside a box, a list etc. ALGOL introduced parameter passing. Where information is passed from a sub program. It is either pass by value or refrence. People think of this as protection. ALGOL also introduced Dynamic Arrays. Dynamic Arrays are list of a particular set of values. These arrays are flexible and are able to be adjusted if needed to. ALGOL also introduced Reserved words. These words are defined earlier and have special meaning towards computer languages. ALGOL has also introduced many types like int, real, compl, bool, char, bits etc. For more info click <a href = https://study.com/academy/lesson/algol-types-history.html>here</a></p>
<h4> Fortran </h4>
<p>FORTRAN was designed for scientists and engineers. FORTRAN was majorly used and apperciated by people present in those feilds listed. For the last 30 years FORTRAN was used for many reasons like the creation of bridges, aeroplane structures. FORTRAN is also used for automation control, and the analysis of scientific data. FORTRAN was created in 1957 by John Backus. Previous programming was conducted in machine language or pottentially in an assembly language. This required the programmer to conduct and create instructions in a binnary or hexadecimal arthmetic manner. Backus created a much more accessible way to communcate and collaborate between computers. FORTRAN introduced the rapid conduction of computer programs that ran efficently and very similar to coded in machine language. As there was a problem with inneficent programms. FORTRAN was very useful as it a higher-level third generation language. FORTRAN was the number one choice during the 1950s. It was updated numuerous times in order to enhance the language and keep up the competetion. FORTRAN 77 and FORTRAN 90 was later introduced. FORTRAN has survivied for a long period of timer due to its software interia. In FORTRAN there are Built in supports for arguments, large sets of functions, support and assitance for large numbers, strong memory pointers and also support for different array notations.

<h4> COBOL</h4>
<p>Massive COBOL codebases are used constantly globally, and are running exactly the same as when they were first created. The main aim of this language was to enhance the portability between computer systems, this makes naviagtion and movement between softwares much easier especially on different hardwares, create English like syntax compared to other computer programming languages. Due to this type of syntax this attractided a wider range of audience and to adapt to future changes if made. When created COBOL became the default choice for writing buisness applications. COBOL was very fast spreading. This was because of there network effects. One network effect was IBM . Due to IBM sticking around COBOL also stuck around for a long period of time. COBOL was pottentially running 80% of all buisness apps. Developers wanted FORTRAN to be understood by non-programmers, like accountants, financial employees, buisness professionals. COBOL is very similar to Python as they are both verbose. COBOL is divided into multiple strict rules. One rule is identifcation division, where it contained info about the author and the program. Enviorment division which contains info regarding the run time enviorment. Data division which contains files and work storage sections. It also describes the files and variables used in the particular program. Lastly the procedure division where all logical code is written and is broken down in sentences, statements, paragraphs etc. For more info click <a href = https://www.infoworld.com/article/3539057/what-is-cobol-cobol-programming-explained.html>here</a></p>
