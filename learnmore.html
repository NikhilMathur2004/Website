<h4>Ada Lovelace</h4>
<p>Ada Lovelace was the daughter of poet Lord Byron. Ada Lovelace always demostrated her gift for mathamatics. She translated many different invensions and added her own touches/comments. Lovelace was resposnible for introducing many new computer systems/concepts. Lovelace is considered to be the first computer programmer. In early years Lovelace's mother insisted that she seeked tutoring regarding math and science. These challenging subjects were not standard fare for woman back then. Ada's mother believed that learning these rightous subjects will avoid Ada developing into a moody and unperdictable temperament. The mother insisted and executed many actions in order to develop Lovelaces wellbeing. For example forcefully lying stil for extended amounts of time. Lovelaces mom believed that this could pottentially enhance self control. Later on in life Ada demostrated extensive knowlege and talent regarding numbers and languages. Ada met Charles Babbage at the age of 17. Through Babbages freindship and coppertation Ada began to study advanced maths. Ada was facinated by Charles Babbages creations and translated Babbages analytical engine. She added her own thoughs and ideas and also translated the text from French into English. Ada theorized a method regarding a method so it could repeat a number of steps in a loop. Ada was very popular and was honored for her work.

<h4> George Boole</h4>
<p>George Boole, was an English mathematican. He helped establish and construct modern symbolic logic. His logic revolved around algerbra. This is now called Boolean Algerba. Boolean Algerba is the basics for designing a computer. Boole was taught math by his father, was was a tradesman. His father also taught him how to construct optical instruments. Boole was mostly self taught regarding math. When Georges fathers buisiness was declined, George had to work to support the family. George had to work extra and earn much money for assistance. George opened his own in Lincoln when he was 20. During leasure time he used to read multiple books like Issacs Newton Principia and other Math journals. George becan to solve advanced math problems. George then submitted his research regarding Theory of Analytical Transformations. These papers were on different math equations and algebraic problems. Most algebric problems is regarding linear transformation. George earned various gold medals for mathematics. George was great for explaining methods regarding algerbra and calculus combined. Boole realized that his algebra could be implemented into logic. Boolean Algebra was one mathematical logic he created which identifies the relationship with ideas and objects. Boolean algebra is applied to se theory. In many mathamatical terms Boolean Algebra is present. Boolean Algebra is essential for electronic digital computers.

<h4> Charles Babbage </h4>
<p>Charles Babbage was a English mathematican and inventor. Charles was known for creating the first digital computer. In 1812 Babbage help found adn create the Analytical Society. The main objective was to introduce new developments present in Europe and convert it into English mathematicans. Babbage had multiple ideas regarding calculating mathamatical tables. Later on with his knowledge he constructed a valid small calculator which was able to evaluate and peform mathematical computations ranging to eight decimals. In the 1823 Babbage had planes to create a new machine. He obtained goverment support. Babbage needed the development of different mechanical engineering techniques. During the 1830s Babbage created and introduced plans for the new systems "Analytical Engine". This engine was known as the forerunner of the modern digital computers. In this particular system/device it could solve any arithmetical equation following the instructions portrayed by the punched cards, there was a memory unit which was able to store numbers, and many other features which are also present in todays modern digital computers. In 1942 Ada Lovelace translated the French Analytical Engine into English. She also implemented her own comments. She published and it explained how it could be peformed to solve many calculations. Babbage was recognized for his notibale contributions. Like assisiting the modern postal system present in England. Babbage also created the first acuarial tables. He invented many innovative technical peices. To learn more click <a href = https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Babbage> here</a></p>
